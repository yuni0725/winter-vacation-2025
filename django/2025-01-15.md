#### Today I Learned : Creation of Super user / Diffent of Framwork and Library / Concept of App in Django

> ## Write some things you want to remind!

- We use this command `python manage.py createsuperuser` to create superuser of Django

- Library and Framework is different. Developer "use" Library. In the terms of Framework, Framework use Developers code.

- In Django, everything is with app. App is something like atom. There is file and logic. We seperate things to app. This can make project encapsulate(캡슐화하다)

> ## Write some your thoughts!

- I joined to Django Chanllenge. It looks like tough times are ahead...
