#### Today I Learned : #7 ORM

> ## Write some things you want to remind!

- All models have '.objects()' method. This make us to get, filter, create data without using SQL.

- Queryset make us to do chain operations

- Lookup operation(double underline operation)

  - ex) Entry.objects.get(property\_\_condition)

- Reverse Accessor
  - Why do we use this : We can access reverse with foreign key.
  - ex) Room point(FK) User / I want to find Room that pointing User
  - we use '\_set' method, shortcut of filtering / and automatically created.
  - Also, we can set 'related_name' property on foreign key method.

> ## Write some your thoughts!

- This is awesome...

- Reverse Accessor will be useful making mypage, or user profile.
