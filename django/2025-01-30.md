#### Today I Learned : #10.6 ~ #11.9

> ## Write some things you want to remind!

- Implement GET, POST, PUT, DELETE method by my hand

- I realized there is shortcut : "APIView", "ModelSerializer"

- It's pretty hard to make api to get relationship(FK, ManyToMany)

> ## Write some your thoughts!

- Shortcuts are not always better. This can make me forget more

- Maybe I should study about POSTing api with relationship with Challenge.
