- SerializerMethodField

  - We can add model method to serializer
  - In room model there is rating method(return average rate)
  - We can get that rating method with this

- We can add context.
  - We can give anything to serializer
  - Use this by giving 'request'
  - By this, we can make 'is_owner'(check request.user == room.owner)
