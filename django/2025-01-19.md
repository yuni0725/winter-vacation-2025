> ## Write some things you want to remind!

- We have to give default vale when we add non-nullable field(column) for existed user.

- We can have relationship with other models.

- One to Many is one object have many object.

  - Such as owner and room
  - owner : [room1, room2, room3]

- Many to Many is many object have many object.

  - Such as rooms and amenities
  - [amenity1, amenity2, amenity3] = [room1, room2, room3]

- class Meta

  - ```python
    class Model:

        """Model definition"""

        class Meta:
            abstract = True

    ```

  - This property prevent Django add this model to database.
  - By this, we can make common model.
