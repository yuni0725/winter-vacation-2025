#### Today I Learned : Migration of Django

> ## Write some things you want to remind!

- We use 'poetry shell' command to get inside to virtual environment.

- Migration is a action that write something to database.

- By this, we can use models(django already gives to us)

- In document, migration is defined with following sentences : Django's way of propagating changes you make to your models(adding a field, deleting a model) into your database schema.

> ## Write some your thoughts!

- I cannot understand well right now what is migration is. However, I think migration is a great concept of django. Maybe I can understand other ways

- Today, I can study some djangos, but I didn't. Next day, I should spend time studying.
